version 15, 2018/01/22

- disassembler (relative address mode)


version 14, 2010/12/17

- debugger code cleanup in order to make it more portable
- debugger invoked with the key F3 instead of F10, because F10 appears to be
  by default reserved for the system to switch between windows
- all file names converted to lower case


version 13, 2010/07/18

- the application priority changed from realtime to normal
- fixed a bug causing the initial LCD contents to appear distorted at
  increased speed of the emulated CPU


version 11, 2009/12/25

Changes and fixes of the CPU instruction set in order to conform to the
test programs 791401, 791402, 691404:
- the Stack Pointer register can take odd values
- the instruction SXT clears the V flag
- the instruction MFPS sets the flags as the instruction MOVB
- the instructions ASH and ASHC treat the shifted value as signed
- the instructions MUL and DIV set the V flag if the product or quotient
  is outside the range -32768..+32767
- the instructions JMP and JSR with a register as the destination cause
  TRAP 04h instead of TRAP 08h


version 09, 2009/09/23

- selectable data size (byte/word) in the binary editor
- an option to save the modified ROM image
- more accurate RTC chip emulation
- updated serial bus controller emulation
- support for memory cards of size > 64kB


version 08, 2009/08/10

- selectable base of the numeral system used by the debugger
- selectable RAM size


version 07, 2008/02/11

- added keyboard overlay


version 06, 2007/10/24

- fixed bug with the overflow flag calculation in the instructions ADD,
  SUB, CMP, CMPB


version 05, 2007/04/26

- added support for an optional expansion ROM (the self-test launched
  by pressing the key 'T' from the start menu should work now)


version 04, 2007/03/22

- eliminated I/O register write latency
- added support for the display memory address register $E800
- fixed a bug causing the program to crash when the emulated CPU was
  ordered from the Debug Window to execute small count of instructions


version 03, 2007/03/18

- first public release
